<p>The pool at Glen is gnarly to say the least. With a 9 foot drop in, only advanced skaters can do any tricks in it. It has a 4 foot drop in on one side and intermeatate skaters can pump around the bowl for fun.
</p>

<div class="imagetext">
<img width="500" height="250" src="glenhaven-bowl.jpg" alt="">
<p> Glen's bowl is rectangular with a lot of hips to either pump for more speed or to trick over. There are both round and pointed hips. Anyone famillar with transition skateing can ride in this bowl.
</div>
<div class="imagetext">
<img width="500" height="250" src="glenhaven-stepup.jpg" alt="">
<p>There is a bank, a 3 stair step-up, and a six set all right next to each other. If they are up for it, skaters can go for the hubba or one of the two rails this spot has to offer.
