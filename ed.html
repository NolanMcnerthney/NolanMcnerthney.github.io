<p>18,000 sq ft of street skating with ledges, edges, stairs, rails, and banks. By using recycled and/or 
sustainable materials in its construction, and with its native landscaping and on-site stormwater treatment, this site is considered to be the first environmentally sensitive skate plaza ever constructed. 

Tread Lightly is a multifaceted art installation by Dan Garland, integrated into the skate plaza. It is 
meant to provoke thought regarding the intersection between natural and man made environments, and points 
towards a search for balance and sustainability. -Portland's Parks and Recreation

<p>The 5 stair at Ed has a rail in the middle and two hubbas on each sides. Intermediated skaters can practice tricks over the stair set. Advance skaters can go for grinds or slides on the features.

<p> The 3 stair has a rail with a bank on the other side. It is perfect for learning how to do grinds on a slanted rail with a low risk factor because of how close to the ground it is. It is still a challenge to hit, but if you mess up you have hope of catching your fall.
